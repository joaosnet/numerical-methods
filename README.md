## Introduction

The Wheel of Life is a personal assessment tool that helps us visualize and balance different areas of our life. It is represented as a circle divided into 12 equal sections, each corresponding to essential pillars or sectors in our life. These areas include Emotional, Spiritual, Family, Marriage/Partnership, Children, Social, Health, Contribution, Intellectual, Financial, Career, and Emotional (again).

## How to Use

2. Open the Python script: `cd wheel-of-life && python main.py`
3. Adjust the Scales: A graphical interface will be displayed with 12 sliders. Adjust each slider to indicate your satisfaction or dedication level in the corresponding life aspect (scale: 1 to 10).
4. Click "Update" Button: After adjusting the scales, click the "Update" button to visualize the Wheel of Life.

```

### Example 2: Unbalanced Life
